A lab in the cloud for testing, monitoring, and security.

After completing SANS course SEC488: Cloud Security Essentials. I wanted to keep exploring and building off what I learned.

With this project, I want to try the Open Source SIEM tool Wazuh. And have a template for other projects.

My blog is a work in progress, and I am improving it. Here is a link to [Cloudlab Guide](https://blog.edelzamora.tech/posts/CloudLab_Guide/)

## :clipboard: Project Information
